    <p>This project is an engaging, web-based Interactive Solar System Model built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging Three.js for immersive 3D rendering. Users can click on planets to display key facts—such as distance from the sun, size, and composition—enhancing educational value. The model features smoothly animated orbits, achieved through CSS/JavaScript or Three.js, to accurately depict planetary motion. A standout feature is the ability to toggle between 2D and 3D views, offering flexibility in visualization. For added interactivity, subtle sound effects (like a "whoosh" on hover) enrich the user experience. Designed for both learning and exploration, this project combines astronomy education with dynamic web development techniques, making it an ideal tool for students or space enthusiasts. The clean, intuitive interface ensures accessibility, while the technical implementation showcases modern front-end capabilities, including 3D graphics and responsive design. Whether viewed in a classroom or as a personal project, this solar system model demonstrates the creative potential of blending science with interactive web technology.</p>

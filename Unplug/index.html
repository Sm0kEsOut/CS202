    <h1>Unplugging From My Phone For 24 Hours.</h1>

    <p>Unplugging from my phone for an extended period turned out to be a surprisingly refreshing experience. Without the constant urge to check the time or instinctively reach for my phone, I found that the day flowed more smoothly and felt more present overall. It allowed me to be more engaged in the moment rather than distracted by notifications or social media.
        <br>
        <br>Of course, there were moments when I had to use my phone for essential tasks—catching the bus, coordinating work responsibilities, and checking the dining hall menu—but aside from these necessary uses, I made a conscious effort to stay disconnected. This gave me the opportunity to spend quality time with friends and enjoy a more laid-back, tech-free day.
        <br>
        <br>That said, completely stepping away from technology wasn't without its challenges. The NFL Draft happened to fall on the same weekend, which made it tough to avoid ESPN notifications and updates—especially while I was working or socializing. Not being able to keep up with real-time picks or trade news was a little frustrating. Additionally, not having access to music during daily tasks like cleaning or driving made those moments feel unusually quiet and even a bit boring.
        <br>
        <br>Despite these hurdles, the experience showed me how dependent I can be on my phone and how beneficial it can be to occasionally step away from it. It reminded me of the value of being fully present and the importance of taking intentional breaks from technology now and then.</p>

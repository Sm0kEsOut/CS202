    <p class="lead text-center">When thinking about what to propose for Western's campus, Nauman became interested in
        the area just south of the steps between Parks Hall and the Environmental Studies building.<br>
        <br>
        Parks Hall houses the College of Business and speech pathology. The steps may have inspired Nauman to think of
        this area as the University's "front door"—a public entry point. He also began to reflect on the cultural
        symbolism of front stairs and how they could be explored in a more personal, artistic way.<br>
        <br>
        Earlier in his academic life, Nauman focused on math, physics, music, and philosophy. Later, as he began
        creating art, he drew on this broad background. He found a unifying approach that connected these disciplines
        and informed his artistic practice.
